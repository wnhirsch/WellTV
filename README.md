# WellTV
Small application to list TV series using the [TV Maze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api). My solution was based on an [old project](https://github.com/wnhirsch/WellTodoMovies) that was based on the [TodoMovies app](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/todomovies-4/id792499896) using the [TV Movie DB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

#### Features to be accomplished:

- [ ] List all of the series contained in the API used by the paging scheme provided by the API.
- [ ] Allow users to search series by name.
- [ ] The listing and search views must show at least the name and poster image of the series.
- [ ] After clicking on a series, the application should show the details of the series, showing the following information:
  - Name
  - Poster
  - Days and time during which the series airs
  - Genres
  - Summary
  - List of episodes separated by season
- [ ] After clicking on an episode, the application should show the episodeâ€™s information, including:
  - Name
  - Number
  - Season
  - Summary
  - Image, if there is one

#### Bonus Features to be accomplished:

- [ ] Allow the user to set a PIN number to secure the application and prevent unauthorized users.
- [ ] For supported phones, the user must be able to choose if they want to enable fingerprint authentication to avoid typing the PIN number while opening the app.
- [ ] Allow the user to save a series as a favorite.
- [ ] Allow the user to delete a series from the favorites list.
- [ ] Allow the user to browse their favorite series in alphabetical order, and click on one to
see its details.
- [ ] Create a people search by listing the name and image of the person.
- [ ] After clicking on a person, the application should show the details of that person, such
as:
  - Name
  - Image
  - Series they have participated in, with a link to the series details.
